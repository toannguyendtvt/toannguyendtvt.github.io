{"name":"IIIN: Interesting, integrated and interactive news","tagline":"news, trending, social, worth reading","body":"## Keep you updated to things that matter as most people know\r\nThe Internet and social networks bring you various ways to access news and events. First, almost news from official publisher sites are updated quite often, based on editors' perspective, not the audiences. In some case, however, they will not reveal what users are really interested about or some sensitive events (political stuff). On the other hand, news that has been viral on social networks (Facebook and Twitter) are biased toward entertainment, showbiz life, weird stuff and not well-categorized. Those are the reasons we will introduce IIIN. \r\n\r\n## How it works\r\nOur system employs the most sophisticated discovery and ranking algorithms.

Afterward, a ranking system and a categorized system will extract what is the most matter news, fact of each categories. \r\n![this is very first screenshoot](http://c1.f13.img.vnecdn.net/2015/04/26/1-79-8762-1430021210.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Interesting\r\nAll the stories we collect are worth to read, because there are thousands to hundreds of thousands people talking about them and we will keep you updated to the most people.
