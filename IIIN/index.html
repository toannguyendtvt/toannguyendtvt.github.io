<p>The Internet and social networks bring you various ways to access news and events. First, almost news from official publisher sites are updated quite often, based on editors' perspective, not the audiences. In some case, however, they will not reveal what users are really interested about or some sensitive events (political stuff). On the other hand, news that has been viral on social networks (Facebook and Twitter) are biased toward entertainment, showbiz life, weird stuff and not well-categorized. Those are the reasons we will introduce IIIN. </p>

<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h2>

Afterward, a ranking system and a categorized system will extract what is the most matter news, fact of each categories.
